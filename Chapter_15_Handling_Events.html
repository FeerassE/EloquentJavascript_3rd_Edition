<!--
    /***** * Event Handlers ******/

    Browsers allow us to register functions to handlers for human input events.

    'window' is a built-in object provided by the browser that represents the window.

-->

<p>Click this document to activate the handler.</p>

<script>
    window.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("You knocked?")
    })
</script>


<!--
    /********* * Events and DOM Nodes **********/


    Event listeners can also be attached to DOM objects.
    They work only in the context of the object they are attached to.


-->
<button>Click me</button>
<p>No handler here.</p>

<script>
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Button clicked.");
    });
</script>



<!--
    You can also change the 'onclick' attribute on DOM nodes
    and add a handler.
    However, you can only have one handler at a time.
    Whereas the 'addEventListener' method can have
    as many handlers as you want on it.

    'removeEventListener' removes an event listener. It's 
    arguments are the event and the handler function.
-->

<button>Act-once button</button>
<script>
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    function once() {
        console.log("Done.");
        // remove event listener needs a name for the function
        // so I believe anonymous function don't work.
        button.removeEventListener("click", once);
    }
    button.addEventListener("click", once);
</script>

<!--
    /******** * Event Objects *******/
--> 

<!--
    So each event object like "click" or "mousdown" below has
    a bunch of properties we can access with additional information.
    
    Notice that the mousdown event below has a 'button' property
    that tells us which mouse button's been pressed.
-->

<button>Click me any way you want</button>
<script>
  let button = document.querySelector("button");
  button.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
    if (event.button == 0) {
      console.log("Left button");
    } else if (event.button == 1) {
      console.log("Middle button");
    } else if (event.button == 2) {
      console.log("Right button");
    }
  });
</script>


<!--
    /********* * Propagation **********/

    main methods: stopPropagation();
-->

<!--
    Apparently for most handlers registered on nodes with children will
    also recieve events that happein IN the children.

    So a button INSIDE of a paragraph tag that is clicked will also propogate
    to the paragraph that surrounds it!

    Handlers propagate outwards so the most specific handler goes first like
    a button press than the handler on the actual window will fire afterwards.

    'stopPropagation' method can be called on the 'event object' to prevent
    propagation from occuring. ex: user clicks a button inside of another button
    and you want the container button from firing its handler.


    Program below registers 'mousedown' handlers on both a button and the paragraph
    around it.
    Right button calls stop propogation so only button handler will run.

-->

<p>A paragraph with a <button>button</button>.</p>

<script>
    let para = document.querySelector("p");
    let button = document.querySelector("button");
    para.addEventListener("mousdown", () => {
        console.log("Handler for paragraph.");
    });
    button.addEventListener("mousedonw", event => {
        console.log("Handler for button,");
        // prevents para from firing
        if(event.button == 2) event.stopPropagation();
    })
</script>


<!--
    Event objects have a 'target' property that tell you which node they originated from.

    Program below adds an event listener on the outer node(body) and finds out which button
    was clicked by using the target property.
-->

<button>A</button>
<button>B</button>
<button>C</button>
<script>
    document.body.addEventListener("click", event => {
        if (event.target.nodeName == "BUTTON") {
            console.log("Clicked", event.target.textContent);
        }
    });
</script>



<!--
    /********** * Default Actions ********/

    main method: preventDefault()
-->

<!--
    Many events have default actions associated with them.
    - clicking a link takes you to link's target
    - pressing the down arrow makes browser scroll donw
    - right click opens context menu
    - etc...


    JavaScript event handlers happen BEFORE the default behavior happens.
    You can call 'preventDefault' method on an event object in the handler to
    stop the default action from occuring. 


    Program below prevents you from following the link.

-->

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a>
<script>
  let link = document.querySelector("a");
  link.addEventListener("click", event => {
    console.log("Nope.");
    event.preventDefault();
  });
</script>


<!--
    Some browsers prevent actions from being interfered with.
-->


<!-- 
    /* Key Events /
-->

<!--
    'keydown' event fired by browser when keyboard is pressed.
    'keyup' event is fired when button is released
-->

<p>This page turns violet when you hold the V key.</p>
<script>
  window.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    if (event.key == "v") {
      document.body.style.background = "violet";
    }
  });
  window.addEventListener("keyup", event => {
    if (event.key == "v") {
      document.body.style.background = "";
    }
  });
</script>

<!--
    'keydown' fires as many times as the key repeats, which means if you hold it down, it'll keep firing.

    The event object has a 'key' property tells you which key was pressed as a string.

    'shift', 'control', 'alt' and 'meta' also fire 'key' events.

    To check for combinations of these keys and other keys you can look at the event object's 
    'shiftKey', 'ctrlKey', 'altKey' and 'metaKey' properties:


-->
<p>Press Control-Space to continue.</p>
<script>
  window.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    if (event.key == " " && event.ctrlKey) {
      console.log("Continuing!");
    }
  });
</script>

<!--
    document.body is usually where 'key' events originate from.

    Apparently it's best not to caputre what is being typed by using key events.
-->


<!--
    /************ * Pointer Events *************/

    Two ways to points at the things at screen:
    - Mice(including touchapds and trackballs)
    - Touchscreens
-->


<!--
    /**** Mouse Clicks ****/

    'mousedown' - fire when mouse button pressed down - origin is DOM node that the pointer is above
    'mouseup' - fire when mouse button released - origin is DOM node that the pointer is above

    After the 'mouseup' event, the 'click' event fires on the node that is most specific to both press and release actions.
    This means if I 'mousedown' on one paragraph and then 'mouseup' on ANOTHER paragraph, the 'click' event happens on the element that
    contains BOTH paragraphs.

    'dbleclick' (doubleclick) event fires after two clicks that occur close together. ( I believe the first two clicks fire separately though
    and then 'dblclick' fires)

    The mouse event has can tell you where it occurs with the 'clientX' and 'clientY' properties relative to top-left corner of window or,
    'pageX' and 'pageY' which is relative to top-left of document(imagine scrolling to the page to see difference).

    Program below creates a simple drawing program:
-->

<style>
        body {
          height: 200px;
          background: beige;
        }
        .dot {
          height: 8px; width: 8px;
          border-radius: 4px; /* rounds corners */
          background: blue;
          position: absolute;
        }
      </style>
      <script>
        window.addEventListener("click", event => {
          let dot = document.createElement("div");
          dot.className = "dot";
          // The minus 4 below I believe makes them draw at the top left of the mouse pointer
          dot.style.left = (event.pageX - 4) + "px";
          dot.style.top = (event.pageY - 4) + "px";
          document.body.appendChild(dot);
        });
      </script>


<!-- 
    /* Mouse Motion

    'mousemove' event is fired whenever the mouse moves. Allows you track it's movement.
    
    
-->

<p>Drag the bar to change its width:</p>
<div style="background: orange; width: 60px; height: 20px">
</div>
<script>
  let lastX; // Tracks the last observed mouse X position
  let bar = document.querySelector("div");
  bar.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
    if (event.button == 0) {
        // Uses the 'x' position value relative to the top left of the window.
      lastX = event.clientX;
      // notice that mousemove is registered to the window so even if you move out of the rectangle it will still change the width.
      window.addEventListener("mousemove", moved);
      event.preventDefault(); // Prevent selection
    }
  });

  function moved(event) {
    if (event.buttons == 0) {
        // when you release the mouse button remove the listener,
        // buttons == 0 means no buttons are pressed.
      window.removeEventListener("mousemove", moved);
    } else {
      let dist = event.clientX - lastX;
      // offsetWidth is a property that describes the width of an element including it's border. 
      // Math.max chooses the higher value, either ten or the other value. This makes sure that the bar is at least 10.
      let newWidth = Math.max(10, bar.offsetWidth + dist);
      bar.style.width = newWidth + "px";
      lastX = event.clientX;
    }
  }
</script>


<!--

    event.buttons is the sum of all of the buttons sodes pressed:
    - left button is code 1
    - right button is code 2
    - middle button is code 4

    *Note* 'buttons' codes are different to 'button' codes. Browser's are built poorly apparently. 
-->


<!--
    /***** Touch Events *****/

    Instead of 'mouseup', 'mousedown' and 'click' we can use other touch screen specific events. 

    'touchstart' event fires when a finger starts touching the screen.
    'touchmove' event fires when moving a finger across the screen.
    'touchend' event fires when finger stops touching screen.

    Each of these events has an object called 'touches' which holds an array-like
    object of contact points, each of which has its own 'clientX', 'clientY',
    'pageX' and 'pageY' properties.

    Program below show red circle around every touching finger:
-->

<style>
        dot { position: absolute; display: block;
              border: 2px solid red; border-radius: 50px;
              height: 100px; width: 100px; }
      </style>
      <p>Touch this page</p>
      <script>
        function update(event) {
          for (let dot; dot = document.querySelector("dot");) {
            dot.remove();
          }
          for (let i = 0; i < event.touches.length; i++) {
            let {pageX, pageY} = event.touches[i];
            let dot = document.createElement("dot");
            dot.style.left = (pageX - 50) + "px";
            dot.style.top = (pageY - 50) + "px";
            document.body.appendChild(dot);
          }
        }
        window.addEventListener("touchstart", update);
        window.addEventListener("touchmove", update);
        window.addEventListener("touchend", update);
      </script>


<!-- 
    Apparently you want to preventDefault on 'touch' events because it prevents their default 
    behaviour frome happening such as scrolling on a swipe or a mouse click. 
-->


<!--
    Scroll Events

    'scroll' events can tell you where the user is looking (to disable off-screen animation)
    or showing indication of progress (by highlighting parts of a table of contents or 
    showing a page number)
-->

<style>
        #progress {
          border-bottom: 2px solid blue;
          width: 0;
          position: fixed;
          top: 0; left: 0;
        }
      </style>
      <div id="progress"></div>
      <script>
        // Create some content
        document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(
          "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ".repeat(1000)));
      
        let bar = document.querySelector("#progress");
        window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
          let max = document.body.scrollHeight - innerHeight;
          // pageYOffset is the number of pixels currently scrolled
          // pageYOffset is divided by the maximum scroll position
          // and is a precentage so we multiply by a hundred
          // and add '%' symbol to make it relative to the width of the
          // screen.
          bar.style.width = `${(pageYOffset / max) * 100}%`;
        });
</script>

<!--
    preventDefault doesn't prevent the scrolling from taking place. Event handler
    is called only 'after' the scroll takes place.
-->


<!-- 
    /****** * Focus Events *******/

    When you click on an 'element' it has focus. When you click away its 'blurred'
-->

<p>Name: <input type="text" data-help="Your full name"></p>
<p>Age: <input type="text" data-help="Your age in years"></p>
<p id="help"></p>

<script>
  let help = document.querySelector("#help");
  let fields = document.querySelectorAll("input");
  for (let field of Array.from(fields)) {
    field.addEventListener("focus", event => {
      let text = event.target.getAttribute("data-help");
      help.textContent = text;
    });
    field.addEventListener("blur", event => {
      help.textContent = "";
    });
  }
</script>


<!--
   /******* * Load Event ******/

    The 'load' event fires after a page finishes loading.

    Allows you to do things once the page is loaded.

    'beforeunload' event fires when a page is closed. The main
    use of this event is prevent the user from accidentally lsing
    work by closing the document.
-->


<!--
    /******* * Events and the Event Loop *******/

-->

<!--
    Events are asynch.

    Remember that events have to wait for the other scheduled
    events to occur before they happen.

    Long running event handlers or too many of them will make
    the website run slow and lag.

    How do we do time consuming things in the background without
    freezing the page?

    A 'worker' is a javascript process that runs along the main script on
    its own timeline (I guess it's own event loop?)

    Workers do not share their global scope with the main script, so they must send
    data through 'messages'.
-->
<script>
    // Let's say this is a file called 'squareworker.js'
addEventListener("message", event => {
    postMessage(event.data * event.data);
  });

</script>

<script>
// In the main file, we create Worker object, that send and receives messages
// form the worker file.

let squareWorker = new Worker("code/squareworker.js");
squareWorker.addEventListener("message", event => {
  console.log("The worker responded:", event.data);
});
squareWorker.postMessage(10);
squareWorker.postMessage(24);

</script>


<!--
    /******** * Timers ********/

    You can remove timers, animations and intervals with different functions like:
    - clearTimeout 
    - cancelAnimationFrame
    - clearInterval
-->
<script>
let bombTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("BOOM!");
  }, 500);
  
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) { // 50% chance
    console.log("Defused.");
    clearTimeout(bombTimer);
  }

  let ticks = 0;
let clock = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("tick", ticks++);
  if (ticks == 10) {
    clearInterval(clock);
    console.log("stop.");
  }
}, 200);
</script>


<!--
    /********* * Debouncing ********/
-->

<!--
    Some events occur many times like the "mousemove" and "scroll". 
    If you attach event handlers to them, they will fire many times
    and could slow things down if they do too much.
    You can use 'setTimeout' to mitigate this problem. This is called
    'deboucning.'

    The program below waits until there is a pause (500 milliseconds) before 
    logging "Typed!".
-->

<textarea>Type something here...</textarea>
<script>
  let textarea = document.querySelector("textarea");
  let timeout;
  textarea.addEventListener("input", () => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => console.log("Typed!"), 500);
  });
</script>

<!--
    Program below fires every 250 milliseconds during a series of events not after.
-->

<script>
        let scheduled = null;
        window.addEventListener("mousemove", event => {
          if (!scheduled) {
            setTimeout(() => {
              document.body.textContent =
                `Mouse at ${scheduled.pageX}, ${scheduled.pageY}`;
              scheduled = null;
            }, 250);
          }
          // Why is scheduled being called again?
          scheduled = event;
        });
</script>


<!--
    /****** * Summary ******/
-->

<!--
    Pressing a key fires "keydown" and "keyup" events. Pressing a mouse 
    button fires "mousedown", "mouseup", and "click" events. Moving the 
    mouse fires "mousemove" events. Touchscreen interaction will result 
    in "touchstart", "touchmove", and "touchend" events.

    Scrolling can be detected with the "scroll" event, and focus changes 
    can be detected with the "focus" and "blur" events. When the document 
    finishes loading, a "load" event fires on the window.
-->
