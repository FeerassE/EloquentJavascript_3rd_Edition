# Annotated Eloquent Javascript 3rd Edition

This is my annotated version of Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition.

My notes start from Chapter 6, but Chapters 1 to 5 are easier to understand if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

I would characterize this book as Intermediate.

I am having trouble with understanding Chapters 11 and 12. If you'd like to help me understand, send me a message or email.
