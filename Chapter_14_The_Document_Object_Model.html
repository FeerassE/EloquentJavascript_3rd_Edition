/*
When opening a web page, browser retrieves the page's HTML text and parses it.
Browser builds up a model of the document's structure and uses this model to draw 
the page on the screen. 
*/


/******** * Document Structure *******/

// Each tag is an object. 

// The global binding 'document' gives us access to these objects.
// It's 'documentElement' property refers to the object representing the <html> tag.

// Every HTML document has a 'head' and a 'body', and also has a 'head' and 'body' property to represent
// those elements. 



/********** * Trees ***********/

// The Document Object Model is a nested structure.
// Each node (branch) can have children (smaller branches) which in turn have their own children and so on. 

// A datastructure is called a 'tree' when it branches and none of its nodes are contained in themselves and
// the structure also has a well defined root.
// The DOMs root is document.documentElement

// Trees are better for look ups than flat arrays.

// Trees have nodes which can have child nodes.
// Leaves are like the values in the Egg language program. They do not have children.
// Text is a leaf in the DOM.

// DOM Nodes are the 'elements' like document.body

// DOM node objects have a 'nodeType' property.
// The 'nodeType' property has a code (number) to represent the node type.
// Code 1 is for 'elements'. The constant property is called Node.ELEMENT_NODE.
// Code 3 is for text nodes. The constant property is called Node.TEXT_NODE
// Code 8 is for comments. The constant property is called Node.COMMENT_NODE



/************ * Moving Through the Tree ************/

// DOM nodes contain links to other nearby nodes.

// Every node has a 'parentNode' property that points to the node it is part of.
// Every element node(node type 1) has a 'childNodes' property that is an array-like object with 
// its children.

// Apparently you can move through the tree using this parent and child links.

// There are also convience links that allow you traverse more easily:
// 'firstChild' property points to the first child element
// 'lastChild' property points to the last child element.
// 'previousSibling' points to the node with the same parent, that is directly before this node.
// 'nextSibling' points to the node with the same parent, that is directly after this node. 
// 'children' property is like childNodes but contains only type 1 children. Let's you ignore 'Text' children. 

// If there is no child than ____Child properties point to null.
// If there is no previous or next sibling than the ____Sibling properties point to null.


// Recursive functions are useful to traverse nested data structures. 

// The following function scans a document for text nodes containing a given string and returns 
// 'true' when it's found.

-->
<script>
function talksAbout(node, string) {
    if(node.nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
        for(let i = 0; i < node.childNodes.length; i++) {
            if(talksAbout(node.childNodes[i], string)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    } else if (node.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE) {
        // If indexOf returns -1 than this whole thing will evaluate to false.
        return node.nodeValue.indexOf(string) > -1;
    }
}

console.log(talksAbout(document.body, "book"));
// -> true;

// So recursive functions apparently have to return up the call stack?

// Check out the Luigi Mansion function in the tests file.

</script>

<!--
/************* * Finding Elements ************/

// Usung document.body and following a fixed path of properties is a bad idea.
// This would assume a precise structure to the document.

-->

<script>
let link = document.body.getElementsByTagName("a")[0];
console.log(link.href);
</script>

<!--
 
// document.body.getElementsByTagName goes and retrieves an array of all of the 
// elements with that tag letter descending from that particular node.



// To get a single node, you'll need to reference it by an 'Id':
// document.getElementById

-->


<p>My ostrich Gertrude:</p>
<p><img id="gertrude" src="img/ostrich.png"></p>


<script>
  let ostrich = document.getElementById("gertrude");
  console.log(ostrich.src);
</script>


<!--
// or you can get elements by class name:
// document.getElementsByClassName

-->

<!--

/********** * Changing The Document ***********/

DOM data structure can be changed easily.

Shape of the document tree can be changed by changing p

Add a child to an element node as the last child by using:
'appendChild'

Insert a node before another node by using:
'insertBefore'

document.body.insertBefore(nodeToBeInserted, nodeToBeShiftedDown)
-->


<p>One</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Three</p>

<script>
  let paragraphs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
  document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]);
</script>

<!--
log:

Three

One

Two

-->


<!--

'replaceChild' method is used to replace a child node with another one. 
It takes as arguments two nodes: a new node and the node to be replaced.

replaceChild(newNode, nodeToBeReplaced);

-->


<!--

/************** * Creating Nodes ***************/


We're going to replace all of the <img> tags with the text in their
'alt' attributes. 

'alt' has text that describes the image. 


To add text nodes use:

document.createTextNode


textNode is the actual text in the tag. 

-->

<p>
    The <img src="img/cat.png" alt="Cat"> in the
    <img src="img/hat.png" alt="Hat">.</p>
  
  <p><button onclick="replaceImages()">Replace</button></p>

  <script>
  function replaceImages() {
      let images = document.body.getElementsByTagName("img");

      for(let i = images.length-1; i >= 0; i --) {
          let image = images[i];
          if (image.alt){
              let text = document.createTextNode(image.alt);
              image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);
          }
      }
  }
  </script>


<!--
We start from the bottom of the array because the DOM is live. So if we replace the image,
it will remove it from the images array so the index numbers will change or something.

If we want a non changing collection of nodes, we should use the Array.from method to makae
the collection a real array.
-->

<script>
    let arrayish = {0: "one", 1: "two", length: 2};
    let array = Array.from(arrayish);
    console.log(array.map(s => s.toUpperCase()));
    // â†’ ["ONE", "TWO"]
</script>


<!--
    Create 'elements' using document.createelement

    We will create a utility called 'elt', which creates an 
    element node and treats the rest of its arguments as children
    to that node.

    Then is then used to add an attribution to a quote

-->

<blockquote id ="quote">
    No book can ever be finished. While working on it we 
    learn just enough to find it immature the moment we turn
    away from it.
</blockquote>

<script>
    function elt(type, ...children){
        let node = document.createElement(type);
        for(let child of children) {
            if (typeof child != "string") node.appendChild(child);
            else node.appendChild(document.createTextNode(child));
        }
        return node;
    }

    document.getElementById("quote").appendChild(
        elt("footer", "-",
        // The elt function can take a node or string as the type
        // If it gets a node, it'll just append that to the parent.
        // If it gets a string, it'll create a text node and append that to
            elt("strong", "Karl Popper"),
            ", preface to the second editition of ", 
            elt("em", "The Open Society and Its Enemies"), 
            ", 1950"));
</script>


<!-- 

    /************ * Attributes ************/

-->

<!-- 
    
    Some element attributes can be accessed as properties of the same name on the
    DOM object ex: href


    You can even create attributes apparently but you cannot access them on nodes 
    by their names only. You have to use the 'getAttribute' and 'setAttribute' Methods


-->

<p data-classified="secret">The launch code is 0000000</p>
<p data-classified="unclassified">I have to feet.</p>

<script>
    let paras = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
    for (let para of Array.from(paras)) {
        if (para.getAttribute("data-classified") == "secret") {
            para.remove();
        }
    }
</script>


<!--

    *Note* The book says to prefix made up attributes with 'data' to ensure they do not
    conflict with any other attributes. So I'm guessing this is where the 'data' convention comes
    from


    *Note* To access the 'class' attribute, use the property name "className" or you can also
    use the name 'class' if you are going to use the 'getAtrribute' or 'setAttribute' methods.
-->


<!--
/**************** * Layout ***********/
-->


<!--
    <p> and <h1> tags are 'block' elements.
    'block' elements take up the whole width of the document and are rendered on separate lines.

    <a> and <strong> tags are 'inline' elements.
    'inline' elements are rendered on the same line with their surrounding text.
    

    Browsers compute a layout before drawing a document.



    The size and position of an element can be access from JavaScript.

    'offsetWidth' and 'offsetHeight' give you the space an element takes up in 'pixels'.

    'pixel' are smallest unit of measurement in the browser to describe screen.

    'clientWidth' and 'clientHeight' give you the size of the space INSIDE the element, ignoring border width.
-->


<p style="border: 3px solid red">
    I'm boxed in.
</p>

<script>
    let para = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];
    console.log("clientHeight:", para.clientHeight);
    console.log("offsetHeight:", para.offsetHeight);
</script>


<!--

    'getBoundClientRect' will give you the 'top', 'bottom', 'left' and 'right' properties of an
    element. They correspond to the distance in pixels from the top-left of the screen.

    Use the scroll positions, 'pageXOffset' and 'pageYOffset' to get the current scroll positions.
-->


<!--
    Lots of layout computations will cause the DOM to run very slow.

    Program below builds X characters 2,0000 pixels wide and measures the time it takes to do so.
-->

<p><span id="one"></span></p>
<p><span id ="two"></span></p>

<script>
    function time(name, action){
        let start = Date.now(); // current time in milliseconds
        action();
        console.log(name, "took", Date.now() - start, "ms");
    }

    time("naive", () => {
        let target = document.getElementById("one");
        while (target.offsetWidth < 2000) {
            target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
        }
    });
    // log: naive took 32ms

    time("clever", function() {
        let target = document.getElementById("two");
        target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));
        // 'Math.ceil' rounds up. It returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.

        // So we find out how many pixels one X is by dividing 'target.offsetWidth by 5' and then dividing
        // 2000 pixels by the length of one 'X' to find out how many we need. 
        let total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));
        target.firstChild.nodeValue = "X".repeat(total);
    })
</script>


<!--
    /************ * Styling ***************/

-->

<p> <a href=".">Normal link</a></p>
<p> <a href="." style="color: green">Green link</a></p>

<!-- You can use the 'style' attribute to change styling -->

<!--
    You can change an element's style through the
    'style' property.
-->

<p id="para" style="color: purple">
    Nice text
</p>

<script>
    let para = document.getElementById("para");
    console.log(para.style.color);
    para.style.color = "magenta";
</script>

<!-- 
    If the CSS style has a hyphen in its name ex: font-family, 
    you must use the camelcase name for JavaScript ex: style.fontFamily

-->


<!-- 
    /************ * Cascading Styles ***********/
-->

<!-- 
    Styling system for html is called CSS, for Cascading Style Sheets.

    Can be written in a style tag.
-->

<style>
    strong {
        font-style: italic;
        color: gray;
    }
</style>
<p>Now <strong>strong text</strong> is italic and gray.</p>

<!--
    Styles in a 'style' attribute applied directly to the node have the highest precedence.
-->

<!--
    # reference ids
    . references classes
-->

<style>
.subtle {
    color: gray;
    font-size: 80%;
  }
  #header {
    background: blue;
    color: white;
  }
  /* p elements with id main and with classes a and b */
  p#main.a.b {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>

<!--
    The more specific the reference in the style tag higher
    the precidence.

<!--
    /************ * Query Selectors **************/
-->

<!-- 
    Query selectors can be used to find DOM elements

    'querySelectorAll' method which is defined both on the 'document' object
    and on the element nodes, takes a selector string and returns a 'NodeList'
    containing all the elements that it matches

    'querySelectorAll' is not live. It's object won't change when you change the document. 
    Also it's not a real array. Need to use Array.from
-->

<p>
    And if you go chasing
    <span class="animal">rabbits</span>
</p>
<p>And you know you're going to fall</p>
<p>Tell 'em a <span class="character">hookah smoking 
    <span class="animal"> caterpiallar</span></span></p>
<p>Has given you the call</p>

<script>
    function count(selector) {
        return document.querySelectorAll(selector).length;
    }
    console.log(count("p"));  // All <p> elements
    // log: 4
    console.log(count(".animal"));   // Class animal
    // log: 2
    console.log(count("p .animal")); // Animal inside of <p>

    console.log(count("p > .animal")); // Direct child of <p>
    // log: 1
</script>

<!---
    /************* * Positioning and Animating **************/
-->

<!--
    'position' style property is set to 'static' as the default for elements. It means that the element
    is a part of the flow of the DOM as related to the HTML structure.

    'position' set to 'relative' leaves it at the same place in the DOM structure but can now augment
    the 'top' and 'left' style values to move it relative to it's place in the HTML.

    'position' set to 'absolute' removes it from the flow of the DOM and allows you to augment the 
    'left' and 'top' properties in relation to the enclosing element whose position property isn't static.

    

    Creating an animation with these principals below:
-->

<p style="text-align: center">
        <img src="img/cat.png" style="position: relative">
</p>
<script>
    let cat = document.querySelector("img");
    let angle = Math.PI/2;
    function animate(time, lastTime) {
        // time is the current time of this frame
        if (lastTime != null) {
            // The angle is changed by the difference between the current and last time
            // because if a function takes a while to run it'll look bad to use a 
            // fixed value.
            angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
        }
        // Multiplied by twenty to give vertical radius.
        cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px";
        // Multiplied by 200 to give horizontal radius. It is much bigger than the vertical radius.
        cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";
        requestAnimationFrame(newTime => animate(newTime, time));
    }
    // requestAnimationFrame passes the current time to the first paramater of its callback function.
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
</script>

<!--
    Remember 'relative' makes it moveable from the top and left properties in relation to it's position in 
    the html document. 

    'requestAnimationFrame' schedules 'animate' to run whenever the browser is ready to repaint the screen.

    'animate' will call 'requestAnimationFrame' when it's done to refresh page.


    *Note* why didn't we update the animation through a frame?
    It's because Browsers don't update their display when a JavaScript program is running.
    They also don't let you interact with the site!

    'requestAnimationFrame' tells the browser we're done and to update.

    Math.sin: tells us the y co-ordinate of a point on a circle
    Math.cos: tells us the x co-ordinate of a point on a circle

    Math.PI gives us the constant pi.
